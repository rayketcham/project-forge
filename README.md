**Your org's next project shouldn't come from a whiteboard.** Project Forge is an autonomous think-tank engine that generates, scores, synthesizes, and scaffolds IT project ideas — turning strategic gaps into GitHub repos with CI/CD, tests, and issues. No meetings required.

Point it at your org. Walk away. Come back to a ranked pipeline of feasibility-scored project concepts, cross-domain mega-projects, and one-click scaffolding into real repositories.

> [!NOTE]
> **Works without an API key.** The auto-scan engine generates ideas locally using seed concepts and domain crossing. Add a Claude API key for richer, more creative generation — but it's optional.

## The Problem

Every quarter, engineering teams ask the same question: **"What should we build next?"**

The answer usually comes from a combination of executive intuition, competitor copying, and whoever talks loudest in the brainstorm. The result? Incremental features, missed market gaps, and zero cross-domain innovation.

Project Forge replaces that process with a structured, autonomous pipeline:

```
Brainstorm (manual, biased, slow)     vs.     Project Forge (autonomous, scored, scaffolded)
------------------------------------------     -----------------------------------------------
- 3 people in a room                          - 12 categories x 4 directions x N seeds
- "I think we should..."                      - Feasibility scored 0.0-1.0
- Sticky notes on a wall                      - Cross-domain super-ideas synthesized
- Nothing gets built                           - One click to GitHub repo with CI/CD
```

### What each step actually does

| Step | Input | Output | Intelligence |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Generate** | Seed concepts + domains | Raw project ideas | Claude Sonnet or local auto-scan engine crosses concepts with domains using 4 generation directions. Contrarian mode specifically challenges assumptions. |
| **Score** | Raw idea | Feasibility score (0.0-1.0) | Evaluates market timing (is the world ready?), competition landscape (who else is doing this?), and MVP complexity (can we ship in weeks, not months?). |
| **Synthesize** | Scored ideas across categories | Super Ideas (mega-projects) | Clusters related ideas from different categories, finds synergies, and produces ambitious multi-phase projects that no single category would generate. |
| **Compare** | Idea + existing repos | Overlap analysis | Keyword extraction + Jaccard similarity against your org's existing repos. Flags duplicates, suggests enhancements, or greenights net-new projects. |
| **Scaffold** | Approved idea | GitHub repository | Creates repo with language-appropriate project structure, CI/CD pipeline, test scaffolding, initial issues, README, and labels. Ready to clone and code. |

---

## Features

| Feature | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **4-Direction Generation** | Basic, contrarian, combinatoric, and crossover idea modes | Contrarian mode alone surfaces ideas your team would never brainstorm |
| **Feasibility Scoring** | Market timing + competition + MVP complexity (0.0-1.0) | Kill bad ideas early, fund good ones with data |
| **Super Ideas Engine** | Cross-category synthesis into mega-projects with phased MVPs | The best projects span multiple domains -- this finds those intersections |
| **Repo Comparison** | Keyword overlap against existing GitHub repos | Never accidentally duplicate effort or miss an enhancement opportunity |
| **Auto-Scaffolding** | GitHub repo + CI + tests + issues + README in one click | From idea to clonable repo in under 60 seconds |
| **Content Dedup** | SHA-256 fingerprinting + input-tuple tracking | Run it 1000 times, never get the same idea twice |
| **Web Dashboard** | Browse, search, filter, approve, reject, scaffold | Non-technical stakeholders can participate in the pipeline |
| **Autonomous Mode** | Cron-driven, no human intervention | Set it and forget it -- ideas accumulate while you sleep |
| **Optional AI** | Works without Claude API key (auto-scan mode) | Zero cost to start, add AI for richer generation later |
| **12 Security Categories** | PQC, NIST, RFC, PKI, vuln research, compliance, and more | Purpose-built for security-focused orgs |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/rayketcham-lab/project-forge.git
cd project-forge
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"

# Run the test suite (175+ tests)
pytest tests/ -v

# Start the dashboard
forge-serve
# -> http://localhost:55443

# Generate ideas (no API key needed)
forge-generate
```

> [!TIP]
> Add `FORGE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude-powered generation. Without it, the auto-scan engine still produces ideas using seed concept crossing -- just less creative ones.

### One-liner for the impatient

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rayketcham-lab/project-forge.git && cd project-forge && pip install -e . && forge-serve
```

---

## Dashboard

The web dashboard at `http://localhost:55443` provides:

**Home** (`/`) -- Real-time stats: total ideas, category breakdown, average feasibility scores, top-rated ideas.

**Explore** (`/explore`) -- Browse all ideas with:
- Full-text search across titles and descriptions
- Filter by category (12 categories)
- Filter by status (pending / approved / rejected / scaffolded)
- Sort by score, date, or category
- Pagination (12 ideas per page)

**Idea Detail** (`/ideas/{id}`) -- Deep view of any idea:
- Full description, category, score breakdown
- Related ideas from the same generation run
- One-click "Compare to Repo" -- select any org repo and see keyword overlap
- Approve / Reject / Scaffold buttons

**Scaffold Flow** -- When you click "Scaffold":
1. Choose GitHub org and visibility (public/private)
2. Project Forge creates the repo with:
   - Language-appropriate directory structure
   - CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
   - Test scaffolding with example tests
   - README with project description
   - 3-5 starter issues based on the idea's MVP plan
   - Labels and milestones
3. You get a link to the new repo. Clone and start building.

## Generation Engine Deep Dive

### Four Generation Directions

The engine doesn't just brainstorm -- it systematically explores the idea space:

| Direction | Strategy | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Basic** | Direct application of seed concept to domain | "Apply certificate transparency to IoT device firmware" |
| **Contrarian** | Challenge conventional wisdom in the domain | "What if CRLs are better than OCSP for edge networks?" |
| **Combinatoric** | Combine two seeds from the same category | "Merge hardware attestation + key escrow into a unified root of trust" |
| **Crossover** | Cross seeds from different categories | "Apply compliance automation patterns to vulnerability disclosure timelines" |

### Input-Tuple Tracking

Every `(seed, domain, direction)` combination is stored. On subsequent runs, the engine skips combinations it's already explored. This means:

- **Run 1**: Generates ideas for all unexplored combinations
- **Run 2**: Only generates for NEW seeds, domains, or directions
- **Run 100**: Still producing novel ideas (as you add seeds and domains)

No wasted API calls. No duplicate ideas. Scale without cost explosion.

### Content Deduplication

Even with tuple tracking, different inputs can produce similar ideas. The dedup engine:

1. Extracts a content fingerprint (SHA-256 of normalized title + description)
2. Checks against all existing fingerprints
3. Rejects duplicates before they hit the database

### Auto-Scan Mode (No API Key)

When `FORGE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set, the engine falls back to local auto-scan:

- Crosses seed concepts with domains using template-based generation
- Produces structured ideas with titles, descriptions, and category tags
- Lower creativity than Claude, but zero cost and fully offline
- Great for testing, development, or budget-conscious usage

---

## Categories

Project Forge ships with 12 security-focused categories, each with curated seed concepts:

| Category | Focus | Example Seeds |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| `pqc-cryptography` | Post-quantum algorithms, migration tooling | ML-KEM, hybrid key exchange, PQ readiness scanners |
| `nist-standards` | FIPS validation, SP 800 series compliance | FIPS 140-3 tooling, NIST CSF mappers, SP 800-53 automation |
| `rfc-security` | IETF RFC implementation for security protocols | TLS 1.3 extensions, ACME protocol, MLS messaging |
| `crypto-infrastructure` | PKI, certificate management, key lifecycle | CT log monitors, OCSP stapling, HSM abstraction layers |
| `security-tool` | Offensive and defensive security toolchain gaps | Fuzzing harnesses, SBOM generators, secret scanners |
| `vulnerability-research` | Novel vulnerability discovery and analysis | Protocol fuzzers, binary diffing, CVE correlation engines |
| `privacy` | Privacy-preserving technologies (PETs) | Differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, MPC tooling |
| `compliance` | Regulatory compliance automation | SOC2 evidence collectors, FedRAMP automation, CMMC mappers |
| `observability` | Security monitoring, logging, anomaly detection | SIEM integration, log correlation, behavioral analytics |
| `devops-tooling` | Developer experience and infrastructure security | Policy-as-code, secrets management, supply chain verification |
| `automation` | Workflow and process automation | Incident response playbooks, change management, approval flows |
| `market-gap` | Products and services missing from the market | Competitive analysis, gap identification, market sizing |

> [!TIP]
> **Adding custom categories:** Edit `src/project_forge/engine/categories.py`. Each category is a dataclass with a name, description, and list of seed concepts. Add yours and the engine picks it up on the next run.

## Contributing

### Adding a new category

```python
# src/project_forge/engine/categories.py
Category(
    name="supply-chain",
    description="Software supply chain security and integrity",
    seeds=[
        "SBOM generation and validation",
        "Build provenance verification (SLSA)",
        "Dependency confusion detection",
        "Package registry security",
    ],
)
```

The engine picks it up automatically on the next generation run.

### Adding a generation direction

Edit `src/project_forge/engine/prompts.py` -- each direction is a prompt template that receives `(seed, domain, category)` and returns structured idea JSON.

### Running the full test suite

```bash
# All tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Just the engine tests
pytest tests/test_engine/ -v

# Just the web tests
pytest tests/test_web/ -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=project_forge --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Linting

```bash
ruff check src/ tests/
ruff format src/ tests/
```
